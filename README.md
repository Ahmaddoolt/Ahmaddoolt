### Hi there, I'm Ahmad üëã

> **I'm not just building apps ‚Äî I'm building solutions.**

As a product-minded engineer, I thrive on transforming complex, real-world challenges into intuitive mobile experiences. My portfolio of 8+ applications, **including products live on the Google Play Store,** demonstrates my commitment to shipping high-quality software.

My key projects include architecting **Unicurve**, a student success platform designed for high-traffic handling to help students navigate their academic journey, and engineering **Sarfisi**, a community transit guide to help commuters and tourists navigate local routes in Syria.

My focus is on writing clean, scalable code with a strong foundation in OOP and a passion for great UI/UX. My freelance experience has taught me to manage projects from concept to launch and to collaborate effectively with clients and peers.
